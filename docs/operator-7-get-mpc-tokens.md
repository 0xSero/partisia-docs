# Get MPC tokens

You can buy MPC tokens from private holders of unlocked tokens. Or you can wait for the soon anticipated public listing.

The current stakes are:

- Reader Node is free, since it does not perform paid services.
- Baker Node 25,000 MPC Tokens.
- ZK Node 75,000 MPC Tokens.
- Oracle Node 250,000 MPC Tokens.

ZK and oracle nodes are an upgraded version of baker nodes, so the oracle and ZK stakes are not including the stake for running a baker node.
Because ZK and oracle nodes still perform baker services of producing and signing blocks.
