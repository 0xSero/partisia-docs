# What are MPC tokens

MPC is the name used for the PBC native token. MPC tokens are used for staking on a Node. This works like buying a deposit. When node operators qualify for performing services on the network they buy a deposit equivalent to the security level of the task they perform. This way the financial interests of the people operating the computers that facilitate transactions on the network are aligned with the users conducting the transactions.  
The staking requirements for different tasks can be read [here](whatisano.md).  
On the outset the MPC Tokens are locked, this means the tokens reside on the account that originally bought them. The MPC Tokens are released to the market and  sold in limited sales rounds. Tokens bought from a specific sales round has a specific date where the tokens become unlocked. Unlocked tokens that are not staked can be traded and transferred freely between the PBC accounts.  

**Functions of MPC tokens:**  
- A stake of MPC tokens works as the entry ticket to becoming a node operator and allows them to take fees for services.  
- The staked MPC tokens provide an additional guaranty. Since the stake can be used to pay compensation for misconduct committed by a node operator.  
- The staked MPC tokens create an incentive structure that allign the user's security interest with the financial interests of the node operators who facilitate the transactions on the network.  

## Why are they named MPC Tokens

On the PBC platform MPC may refer to two different things. MPC is an acronym for secure multiparty computation. Secure multiparty computation (MPC) is the technological speciality of Partisia Blockchain. One could argue that the main technology which seperates Partisia Blockchain from other blockchains is contracts with zero knowledge computations not least MPC. So, instead of naming the tokens after the platform they are named after the most significant technology on the platform.
