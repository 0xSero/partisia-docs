# BYOC and Gas 

**What is BYOC and gas**  
BYOC means bring your own coin. The idea is that you can bring liquid cryptocurrencies onto PBC. A very small unit of BYOC is called gas. This is a term also used on other blockchains. Gas in the blockchain ecosystem is analogous with the fuel you need to get the machines moving. So to move something to the blockchain and change the state of things fuel is needed.

To pay the gas costs of transactions you need to have some amount of BYOC in your account. The economics of the Mainnet Beta is fueled by test ETH. When the chain economy goes real, the cost will be measured in ETH not test ETH. For now, gas can be bought by paying with test ETH, which you can get for free. Still, the measuring in test ETH allow users to estimate what future cost different transactions will be. That knowledge can be used both by the people who write contracts and by the node operators to find out how to optimize potential financial gains from using the chain.

**How does it work**  
To be able to spend and transfer your coins, twins are minted which can interact with the payment scheme of PBC. So, in essence you can put Etherum in your PBC wallet. To pay for services on the blockchain you use the BYOC twins. When you deploy a smart contract on PBC, the contract carries a necessary amount of internal gas to cover the fees connected to the contract. This will be sustaining the contract on the blockchain and any Zero Knowledge or Oracle services that demand special node allocation.
In this way node operators can be compensated for their work by the people who use the services in liquid funds rather than internal MPC tokens.
The first cryptocurrency you are able to use in the BYOC system at PBC is Ethereum. 

## How to get started

The easiest way to make a deposit of ETH s to use the PBC Token Bridge. 


1. Install the [Partisa Wallet Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/partisia-wallet/gjkdbeaiifkpoencioahhcilildpjhgh).
2. Install Metamask [app](https://metamask.io/) or [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).
3. Make an Ethereum account, you can use Metamask to do it. 
4. Change the network in Metamask to Ropsten Test Network in upper right corner, you will first have to enable the test networks in settings.
5. You can get Ropstens test ETH from Faucet. There are many to chose from.
6. Use the  [PBC Token bridge](https://bridge.mpcexplorer.com/) to transfer test ETH from the Ethereum account into the PBC account.

You get a confirmation as seen below if the deposit is successful. Your gas balance in the wallet should now be positive. This means that you can deploy or interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. Read more about smart contracts [here](contract-development.md).
