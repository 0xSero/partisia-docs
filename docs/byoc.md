# BYOC and Gas 

BYOC means bring your own coin. The idea is simply put, that you can bring recognized cryptocurrencies and digital currencies like USDC onto PBC. To be able to spend and transfer your coins, twins are minted which can interact with the payment scheme of PBC. So, in essence you can put Etherum in your PBC wallet - [Get extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/partisia-wallet/gjkdbeaiifkpoencioahhcilildpjhgh). To pay for services on the blockchain you use the BYOC twins. The measured unit of transaction costs is called gas. Gas translates into a small fraction of a BYOC twin. When you deploy a smart contract on PBC, the contract carries a necessary amount of internal gas to cover the fees connected to the contract. This would be sustaining the contract on the blockchain and any Zero Knowledge or Oracle services that demand special node allocation.
In this way node operators can be compensated for their work by the people who use the services in liquid funds rather than internal MPC tokens.
The first cryptocurrency you are able to use in the BYOC system at PBC is Ethereum.
