# Create an account on PBC

If you already got a PBC account in connection with a public or private MPC sale event, you can skip this step and the next.   


Create an account through the [wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/partisia-wallet/gjkdbeaiifkpoencioahhcilildpjhgh).   

Every account has an individual private key. After you create your account it is extremely important that you keep the private key safe. The private key has a public counterpart called a public key. This key is derived from the private key, so the public key can be recovered if lost, but the private key cannot. AN account also has an address which is a number with fewer digits derived from the public key.

You can read more about PBC accounts [here](accounts.md).
