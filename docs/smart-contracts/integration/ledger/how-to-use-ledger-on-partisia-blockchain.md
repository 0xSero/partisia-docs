# How to use Ledger on Partisia Blockchain

A Ledger Device is a hardware wallet that is considered one of the most secure ways to store your digital assets. Ledger uses an offline, or cold storage, method of generating private keys. Ledger is integrated with our block explorer ([Browser])(https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/account).


Install the Partisia Blockchain app on your Ledger device to sign transactions and manage MPC tokens with
the [Partisia Blockchain Browser](https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/account). The Partisia Blockchain app is
developed and supported by the [Partisia Blockchain Foundation](https://partisiablockchain.com/).

### How to receive crypto assets using Ledger

To receive crypto assets you need to save the public key of the ledger. This needs to be the receiving end of a MPC transfer
for Ledger to hold assets on the blockchain for you.

1. Log into an account on Partisia Blockchain that has MPC tokens.
2. Go to
   the [MPC token contract](https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/contracts/01a4082d9d560749ecd0ffa1dcaaaee2c2cb25d881)
   where you
   can [transfer MPC tokens](https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/contracts/01a4082d9d560749ecd0ffa1dcaaaee2c2cb25d881/transfer).
   You need to fill out the receiving [address](../../../pbc-fundamentals/dictionary.md) as your Ledgers public key and the amount of MPC tokens
   you want to send to that account. Its important that you verify it is the correct receiver address, otherwise you will not receive the tokens on your Ledger.

### How to send crypto assets using Ledger

After [connecting with browser](#how-to-connect-the-ledger-device-with-partisia-blockchain-browser) you are now ready to start moving assets around using the Ledger.

1. Go to
   the [MPC token contract](https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/contracts/01a4082d9d560749ecd0ffa1dcaaaee2c2cb25d881)
   where you
   can [transfer MPC tokens](https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/contracts/01a4082d9d560749ecd0ffa1dcaaaee2c2cb25d881/transfer).
   You need to fill out the receiving [address](../../../pbc-fundamentals/dictionary.md) and the amount of MPC tokens
   you want to send.

2. After sending the transaction to transfer MPC tokens, you can see that the Browser waits for approval on the Ledger
   ![interact(2)-waiting for approval.png](interact%282%29-waiting%20for%20approval.png)

3. Review the MPC transfer on the Ledger device by pressing the _right button_ on your Ledger Device and review the different transaction details.
   ![interact(3)-review.jpg](interact%283%29-review.jpg)

    The review consists of:

    * Are you using the correct chain? Ledger will give both Partisia Blockchain and mainnet as chain reviews which are
      both correct for Partisia Blockchain. The screenshot shows [Testnet](../../access-and-use-the-testnet.md) which is
      our developer chain.
      ![Interact(4)-Chain.png](Interact%284%29-Chain.png)

    * Are you using the correct arguments? Its important that you verify the receiving addresses on the device as to
      ensure you are doing the transaction you wanted with the amount you wanted to transfer.
      ![Interact(5)-Arguments.png](Interact%285%29-Arguments.png)

    * If you cannot verify the address of the amount you can reject the transaction on the Ledger.

4. Accept the amount of [gas](../../../pbc-fundamentals/dictionary.md#gas) the transaction costs.
   ![interact(6)-fee.jpg](interact%286%29-fee.jpg)

5. If you want to approve after the review you should click on _Approve_ on the device.
   ![interact(7)-approve.jpg](interact%287%29-approve.jpg)

6. After approval, you can see that the Browser finishes the transaction and the transfer is complete.
