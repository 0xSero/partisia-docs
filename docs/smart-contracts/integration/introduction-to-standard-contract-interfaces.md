# Introduction to Standard Contract Interfaces

Welcome to Partisia Blockchain's collection of standard contract interfaces for smart contracts!The standardized interfaces enable seamless integration and compatibility with existing decentralized applications (DApps) and the broader blockchain ecosystem. The standard contract interfaces ensure interoperability and simplify the development process for different needs.

## Benefits of Standard Contract Interfaces

Working with standard contract interfaces offers several benefits:

1. **Interoperability:** standard contract interfaces enable interoperability by ensuring that your smart contracts can interact with other contracts, applications, and services following the same standards. This facilitates seamless integration into the blockchain ecosystem.

2. **Ecosystem Compatibility:** By adopting widely recognized token and NFT standards, you can easily integrate your contracts with existing wallets, exchanges, and other blockchain services. This compatibility enhances the usability and accessibility of your tokens and NFTs.

3. **Developer Efficiency:** standard contract interfaces provide well-defined structures and interfaces, simplifying the development process. Developers can leverage existing libraries, tools, and documentation related to the standards, saving time and effort.

4. **User Familiarity:** standard contract interfaces are widely adopted, meaning users are already familiar with how tokens and NFTs built on these standards function. Users can confidently interact with your contracts knowing that they adhere to established practices.

## How to Work with Standard Contract Interfaces

To work with Partisia Blockchain's standard contract interfaces, follow these general steps:

1. **Choose the Appropriate interface:** Determine whether your use case requires a token contract or an NFT contract. Select the standard contract interface that aligns with your project's requirements. In general the best practice is to look into Partisia Blockchains [example contracts](../smart-contract-examples.md) to see best practice and start from there with your goal in mind. The specific standards links to an example that showcases the use case.

2. **Understand the Standard:** Familiarize yourself with the specific standard by referring to the relevant documentation, such as [MPC-20](mpc-20.md) for token contracts or [MPC-721](mpc-721.md) for NFT contracts. These standards outline the required actions, state fields, and interfaces that your contract should implement.

3. **Implement the Standard:** Start from one of the [example contracts](../smart-contract-examples.md) and build on that framework your own smart contract using the standard contract interface as a guide. Ensure that you incorporate all the necessary actions, state fields, and other requirements specified in the standard and then expand from there. Starting from an example contract helps you uphold and use those requirements from the start.

4. **Test and Deploy:** Thoroughly test your contract to ensure its functionality and security. Once satisfied, deploy your contract to the desired blockchain network. You can always verify on the [testnet](../access-and-use-the-testnet.md) that your integration was successful.

5. **Integrate and Interact:** After deploying your contract, integrate it with other applications, services, or platforms by following the standard contract interfaces and protocols. This allows your tokens or NFTs to be traded, used in applications, or accessed by users within the blockchain ecosystem.

By following these steps and leveraging Partisia Blockchain's standard contract interfaces, you can create robust and interoperable smart contracts that align with established standards. Remember keeping the standard makes your contract useful for all on the blockchain.
