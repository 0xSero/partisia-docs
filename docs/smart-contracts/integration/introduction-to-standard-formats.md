# Introduction to Standard Formats

Welcome to our collection of standard formats for smart contracts! We provide standardized formats that enable seamless integration and compatibility with existing decentralized applications (DApps) and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Our standard formats ensure interoperability and simplify the development process for different needs eg: token contracts and non-fungible token (NFT) contracts.

## What are Standard Formats?

Standard formats are predefined contract structures that follow widely recognized token and NFT standards. These formats establish a common set of rules and interfaces, allowing developers to create smart contracts that work seamlessly with other applications and platforms in the blockchain ecosystem. By adhering to these standards, you can ensure that your contracts are compatible with various wallets, exchanges, and other blockchain services.

## Benefits of Standard Formats

Working with standard formats offers several benefits:

1. **Interoperability:** Standard formats enable interoperability by ensuring that your smart contracts can interact with other contracts, applications, and services following the same standards. This facilitates seamless integration into the blockchain ecosystem.

2. **Ecosystem Compatibility:** By adopting widely recognized token and NFT standards, you can easily integrate your contracts with existing wallets, exchanges, and other blockchain services. This compatibility enhances the usability and accessibility of your tokens and NFTs.

3. **Developer Efficiency:** Standard formats provide well-defined structures and interfaces, simplifying the development process. Developers can leverage existing libraries, tools, and documentation related to the standards, saving time and effort.

4. **User Familiarity:** Standard formats are widely adopted, meaning users are already familiar with how tokens and NFTs built on these standards function. Users can confidently interact with your contracts knowing that they adhere to established practices.

## How to Work with Standard Formats

To work with our standard formats, follow these general steps:

1. **Choose the Appropriate Format:** Determine whether your use case requires a token contract or an NFT contract. Select the standard format that aligns with your project's requirements.

2. **Understand the Standard:** Familiarize yourself with the specific standard by referring to the relevant documentation, such as [MPC-20](mpc-20.md) for token contracts or [MPC-721](mpc-721.md) for NFT contracts. These standards outline the required actions, state fields, and interfaces that your contract should implement.

3. **Implement the Standard:** Create your smart contract using the standard format as a guide. Ensure that you incorporate all the necessary actions, state fields, and other requirements specified in the standard and then expand from there.

4. **Test and Deploy:** Thoroughly test your contract to ensure its functionality and security. Once satisfied, deploy your contract to the desired blockchain network. You can always verify on the [testnet](../access-and-use-the-testnet.md) that your integration was successful.

5. **Integrate and Interact:** After deploying your contract, integrate it with other applications, services, or platforms by following the standard interfaces and protocols. This allows your tokens or NFTs to be traded, used in applications, or accessed by users within the blockchain ecosystem.

By following these steps and leveraging our standard formats, you can create robust and interoperable smart contracts that align with established standards.
