# Public-key cryptography

Public-key cryptography is a form of cryptography that uses pairs of keys: a public key that may be shared with anyone and a private key that must be kept secret. The public and private keys are generated in mathematically connected pairs. The public key can be used to encrypt a message that can be decrypted by the private key, meaning that anyone can send an encrypted message to any recipient assuming they know their public key. PBC uses elliptic curve cryptography, specifically the curve [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Secp256k1).
