# Onboarding new BYOC

This article is composed of two guides, the first guide is to help you bring in your own coin as a new ERC20 and its
extension tokens to Partisia Blockchains using the PBC
bridge. The second guide is about how to verify a new BYOC proposal.

In order for the
bridge to work between chains, you must have a contract in the Ethereum, Polygon or BNB smart chain
network as well
as on the Partisia
Blockchain network. We provide a template for anyone to tweak and submit a proposal to add the coin
of their choice to
Partisia Blockchain.
This proposal will go to a vote to our node operator committee. The committee has 7 days to
review the proposal and
either accept or reject the proposal.
If it is accepted, the contract will go live and the token will become available as an asset in the
network.

## How to propose a new BYOC coin

To create a proposal of a new BYOC coin you need to be have at least 100.000 MPC tokens
staked [to your own account](../mpc-token-model-and-account-elements.md#stakedtoself).
Besides being able to stake the MPC tokens you need to do the following
technical high level
steps to create a proposal for a new coin:

1. Deploy implementation contract on the chain you want to integrate with.
2. Deploy configured proxy contract on the chain you want to integrate with.
3. Propose a vote on Partisia Blockchain to get node operators consent to enable your new BYOC.
4. When node operators have verified the proposed information and voted yes to the BYOC it will be
   accepted as a mintable coin on Partisia Blockchain. To understand bridging visit our article
   about [bridging coins to PBC](bridging-byoc-by-sending-transactions.md#how-does-the-bridge-work).

The existing BNB bridge is an example of a successful deployment of a new BYOC,
see [implementation contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xf393d008077c97f2632fa04a910969ac58f88e3c)
and [proxy contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x05ee4eee70452dd555ecc3f997ea03c6fba29ac1).

Before preparing the contracts on the integrated chain some information needs to be collected:

- Which integrated chain does the coin reside on (Ethereum, Polygon or BNB Smart Chain)
- What is the current USD value of a single coin

For non-stable coins a Chainlink reference contract on Ethereum that tracks the current price needs
to be available.
See [Chainlink contracts on Ethereum mainnet](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet)

For ERC20 tokens the token contract address and the number of decimals is needed.

## Generating payloads

The below form helps generate the needed binary transactions for deploying on the external chain and
proposing the update on Partisia Blockchain.

The bytecode for the contracts have been populated from the compiled
artifacts [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/partisiablockchain/governance/byoc-contract-eth/-/packages/8687576).

These steps specify what information is needed in the below form, each number corresponds to the same number of a field.

1. Select if the token to be deployed is an ERC20 or a native token
2. Select the chain where the token resides
3. Deploy the implementation contract (note the address for usage in step 4)
4. Fill information needed for initializing the implementation contract
5. Deploy the ERC197Proxy with initialization of the implementation contract (note the address for
   usage in step 6 6)
6. Fill remaining information to prepare a vote on Partisia Blockchain
7. Take the autogenerated Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and create a vote on Partisia Blockchain by going to
   the <a href="https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/contracts/04c5f00d7c6d70c3d0919fd7f81c7b9bfe16063620/proposeUpdate" target="_blank">system update contract in the browser</a>
   create the vote you use the interaction: `PollUpdateType$INVOKE_CONTRACT(6)` vote with the generated RPC from the
   below form in field (7).
8. After the creation of the proposal, we suggest you share your forms details
   with [the community](../../get-support-from-pbc-community.md) to make it easier for
   them to verify your proposal.
9. When node operators have voted, you need to execute the proposal this action costs ~260.000 gas. You can execute the proposal by using the check update interaction on the [system update contract](https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/contracts/04c5f00d7c6d70c3d0919fd7f81c7b9bfe16063620/checkUpdate).

For step 2 and 4 the form below allows using MetaMask to send the transactions.

## How to verify a proposed BYOC

This guide is intended for someone to ensure that a new BYOC proposal is valid. The proposer should have made all the
configuration parameters available (The above form is an example of this) for the node operators to
check.

Fill out the payload form above with all the received information to be able to verify the
payloads, the exact
same
way as the proposer did, [see above](onboarding-new-byoc.md#how-to-propose-a-new-byoc-coin). Field 3 and 5 are contract
RPC deployed on a foreign chain, you need to find their deployment transaction before you can verify its the same RPC.
Field 7 is a transaction to
the [system contract](../../smart-contracts/what-is-a-smart-contract.md#the-different-contract-types-and-their-life-on-the-blockchain)
on PBC. You need to find the initializing transaction of the proposal you are voting on in
the [system update contract](https://browser.partisiablockchain.com/contracts/04c5f00d7c6d70c3d0919fd7f81c7b9bfe16063620). If
no
configuration
is shared with the community, verifying the proposal is very difficult.

When validating the proposal ensure that the parameters match what is expected:

- Does the supplied price match the price of the token?
- Is the name of the token correct?
- Is the supplied reference contract a chain link reference for the bridged symbol? And does the
  decimal count match the ones on the contract?
- Is the supplied ERC20 contract a valid ERC20 contract for the token? And does the decimal count
  match the decimals on the ERC20 contract?

To sum up, you need to find both of the deployed contracts, lookup the transaction that deployed them, find the payload
of
the transaction and verify that this matches exactly the payload generated in the form.

## Configuration parameters

The bytecode for the contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain should be fetched
from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/partisiablockchain/governance/byoc-contract-eth/-/packages/24646551).

For all the files the value in 'bytecode' should be used.
