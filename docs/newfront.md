# The PBC Ecosystem

**Welcome to the documentation page of the Partisia Blockchain.**  

Blockchains are a means to make an immutable record of transactions on a decentralized database. This makes blockchains a useful place to record important information e.g. of a financial, medical or legal nature.

One very popular way in which users interact with the blockchain is to buy NFTs. Here you can see how the user action affect the blockchain.

1. The user buys an NFT through an app on their phone.
2. An Interact-Transaction is sent by the app user account to the Token Contract (An existing smart contract).
3. This invokes the action *transfer* of the contract.
4. The ownership of the NFT is moved to the PBC account associated with the user. And it is added to the ledger.
5. The app confirms the transaction.
