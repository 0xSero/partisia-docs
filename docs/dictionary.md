# Terms commonly used in relations to Partisia technology and infrastructure

The following list is quite long, and you might want to search for the term you are looking for using `CTRL+F` instead of scrolling down.

### ABI
Application binary interface, it is needed when deploying a smart contract. An ABI helps the blockchain interpret the binary version of the contract file.

### Baker Node
A node performing baker services, but not ZK or Oracle services.

### Blocks
A block is the basic component of the blockchain ledger. Each block contains a batch of valid [transactions](transactions.md) and [events](events.md) that have been executed at a given *block time*. The block time is incremental. The chain is started with a genesis block that defines the initial state of the blockchain. Each block has a reference to its parent block thus forming a chain all the way back to the genesis block. Read more [here](block.md).

### BP Node
