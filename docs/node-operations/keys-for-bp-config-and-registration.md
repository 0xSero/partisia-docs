Node operators will need 3 sets of keys to complete node configuration and registration

At this stage you should already have an account private key from the account holding your MPC tokens.

You two generate one more set of keys:
   
1. Generate The Network key pair.   
2. Generate the Finalization key pair.   

## How to get the keys 

1. Go to [KeyGen](https://dashboard.partisiablockchain.com/keygen)   
2. Click generate   
3. Copy the private and public key from the top box - this is your network keypair   
4. Copy the BLS private and public key - this is your finalization keypair   

Now you are ready to complete the node configuration on next page.
