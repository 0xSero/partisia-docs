# Delegated Node Staking

Delegated staking means that you delegate MPC tokens to an account of a node operator, so the node operator can stake
these tokens. If the node operator accept the delegated tokens, they can use these tokens to
run [node services](start-running-a-node.md).


### How rewards and fees work for delegated tokens

You get rewards for delegating tokens to node operators. The rewards are calculated as a factor multiplied with the number of rewardable tokens delegated. $Delegated_{rewardable} = \frac{Released_{MPC}}{Total_{MPC}} Delegated $
