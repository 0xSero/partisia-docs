To ensure a decentralized approval process, the public information about the entity operating the node is verified by an independent third-party company called Synaps.
Your information is verified through a KYB (know your business) or KYC (know your customer) process, where your identity and company credentials are checked.

The processes differ between business and personal accounts.

**You will need to have your ID, access to a webcam for likeness and company documents ready.**

## Verification process for individuals (KYC)

Registering a node on the chain requires that you send personal data on-chain.
The KYC provider Synaps then verifies your identity and the on-chain data you have uploaded.

1. Fill out the form and submit it
1. Go to the [Synaps portal](https://partisiablockchain-kyc.synaps.me/). It is important that the information you provide matches that you sent in the previous step.
