# Complete Synaps KYB/KYC

To ensure a decentralized approval process, the public information about the entity operating the node is verified by an independent third-party company called Synaps.
Your information is verified through a KYB (know your business) or KYC (know your customer) process, where your identity and company credentials are checked.

The processes differ between business and personal accounts.

**You will need to have your ID, access to a webcam for likeness and company documents ready.**

## Verification process for individuals (KYC)

Registering a node on the chain requires that you send personal data on-chain.
