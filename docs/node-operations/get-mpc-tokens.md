If you have not already bought the prerequisite amount of MPC tokens, you are welcome to contact us for further information. [Reach out here](https://kyc.partisiablockchain.com/).

#### The current stakes are:

- Reader Node is free, since it does not perform paid services.
- Baker Node 25,000 MPC Tokens.
- ZK Node 75,000 MPC Tokens.
- Oracle Node 250,000 MPC Tokens.

ZK and oracle nodes are an upgraded version of baker nodes, so the oracle and ZK stakes are not including the stake for running a baker node.
Because ZK and oracle nodes still perform baker services of producing and signing blocks.
