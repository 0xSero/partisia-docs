information. [Reach out here](https://kyc.partisiablockchain.com/).

For the following you need the Metamask Wallet extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)
or for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/).

## Staking tokens

1. You need to be able to cover gas costs of transaction, click [here](../pbc-fundamentals/byoc.md) for help to get gas in your account.
1. Log in to your account. Click upper right corner (View activity). This will take you to your account page.
1. Click on _Node register_ on the menu bar and then click on _Manage MPC Tokens_. From there, click _Stake MPC Tokens_ and stake 25k or more tokens to your account.

**The current stakes are:**

- Reader Node is free, since it does not perform paid services.
- Baker Node 25,000 MPC Tokens.
- ZK Node 75,000 MPC Tokens.
- Oracle Node 250,000 MPC Tokens.

ZK and oracle nodes are an upgraded version of baker nodes, so the oracle and ZK stakes are not including the stake for
running a baker node. Because ZK and oracle nodes still perform baker services of producing and signing blocks.
